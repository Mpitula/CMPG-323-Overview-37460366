## Detailed Solution Design

**Overview:**
- Develop a web API and a web application to store and manage telemetry data linked to projects and clients.
- The web application will support CRUD operations for project and client information.
- Ensure robust documentation, planning, and reporting components to visualize the benefits of automation.

**Architecture:**
- The solution will be cloud-hosted or on-premise.
- Follows industry standards for reusability and scalability.
- Key components include:
  - Front-end: Web application for user interactions.
  - Back-end: Web API for data storage and processing.
  - Database: Secure and scalable storage for telemetry data.
  - Reporting Tool: For visualizing time and cost savings.

**Modules:**
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or Angular)
- **Back-end:** Web API (Node.js, Express)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MySQL
- **Reporting:** Power BI or Tableau

**Technologies:**
- **Frontend:** React.js, Angular
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Reporting:** Power BI, Tableau

## Data Design

**Data Model:**
- **Entities:**
  - Client: id, name, contact_info, etc.
  - Project: id, client_id, name, start_date, end_date, etc.
  - TelemetryData: id, project_id, time_saved, cost_saved, date_recorded, etc.

**Database Schema:**
- **Client Table:**
  - id (Primary Key)
  - name (VARCHAR)
  - contact_info (VARCHAR)
  
- **Project Table:**
  - id (Primary Key)
  - client_id (Foreign Key)
  - name (VARCHAR)
  - start_date (DATE)
  - end_date (DATE)
  
- **TelemetryData Table:**
  - id (Primary Key)
  - project_id (Foreign Key)
  - time_saved (FLOAT)
  - cost_saved (FLOAT)
  - date_recorded (DATE)

**Data Flow:**
1. User inputs project and client data through the web application.
2. Data is sent to the web API and stored in the database.
3. Telemetry data is recorded and linked to specific projects.
4. The reporting tool retrieves data and visualizes time and cost savings.

## Technical Assumptions

- Users have access to the internet and modern web browsers.
- The solution will handle a moderate number of concurrent users.
- The database will scale as data grows.
- Users will need to log in to access the web application.

## Technical Caveats

- Scalability might be limited by the database performance.
- Internet connectivity issues can affect the usability of the web application.
- Initial setup and configuration of the cloud-hosted solution may require additional time.

## Wireframes

- **Login Page:** A simple form for user authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Overview of clients and projects with key metrics.
- **Client Management:** CRUD operations for client data.
- **Project Management:** CRUD operations for project data.
- **Telemetry Data Entry:** Form to enter time and cost savings data.
- **Reporting Page:** Visual representation of time and cost savings.
